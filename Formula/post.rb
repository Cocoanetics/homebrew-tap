  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Post requires server credentials before use:

         post keychain add <server-id> --host <host> --port 993
         postd start

      No config file needed — servers are auto-discovered from the keychain.
      For advanced settings, create ~/.post.json (see GitHub for details).
